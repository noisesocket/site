The **NLS** (or **NoiseLingoSocket**) framework builds on the Noise Protocol Framework and the NoiseSocket encoding layer to provide a rich set of features for building complex protocols.  Protocols based on NLS can negotiate their choice of Noise protocol, PSK, and transport phase options, and can also exchange **evidence blobs** for their static public keys (e.g. certificates).
